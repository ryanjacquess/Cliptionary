Ever started reading in a new language only to quickly realize the importance of a dictionary crutch? Remember how irritated you got opening a new search window every second word?

Fear no more! *jisho-board* has got your back. With automatic searches right from your clipboard, you can forget about manually researching every word!

## Setting up
*jisho-board* requires the following dependencies to be installed on your system:
 - npm
 - node.js
 - browser-sync

### Unix with homebrew package manager
```sh
$ brew install npm
$ brew install node
$ npm install -g browser-sync
$ node ./jisho-board.js
```
Alternatively you could directly install `npm` and `node.js` from their respective websites.
### Windows
TODO
```sh
node .\printClipboard.js
```
